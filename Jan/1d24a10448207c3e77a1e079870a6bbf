The Senate and House of Representatives seem at loggerheads over the domiciliation of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) despite the looming threat of Nigeria’s expulsion from the Egmont Group. The bill to grant financial and operational autonomy to the unit, which has been passed by both legislative chambers, is before the conference committee of the National Assembly, which is required to harmonise the discrepancies in both versions of the legislation.  Chairman Senate committee on anti-corruption and financial crimes Senator Chukwuka Utazi ‎ raising a Point of Order informed Senate that his colleague in the house of representatives has refused to honour scheduled meetings, therefore seeking the intervention of the President of the Senate in the matter. Senator Utazi, blamed the delay in transmission on the insistence of the House committee to domicile the unit within the EFCC. ‎  President of the Senate,  Bukkola Saraki in his remarks said he will meet with the speaker of the House of Representatives to sort out the matter. Our correspondent Raliat Adenekan reports that the Egmont group had in July 2017 suspended Nigeria for reasons related to financial intelligence, mandating the Nigerian government to make NFIU autonomous in its funding operations and management of Intelligence.
