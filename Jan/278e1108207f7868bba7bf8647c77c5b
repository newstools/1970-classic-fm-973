The World Bank has declared that the global economy is showing solid momentum with an expected growth rate of 3.1 percent in 2018, its strongest performance since 2011. Speaking at the ongoing Spring Meetings in Washington DC, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim noted that this was made possible as the recovery in investment, manufacturing and trade continues, and also as commodity-exporting developing economies benefit from firming commodity prices.  Our correspondent reports that the World Bank Group President went on to state that the challenge now is to ensure that strong growth will translate into "inclusive growth", so that the benefits of global economic integration are enjoyed by all members of society. He said the period of robust growth is a great opportunity to invest in human and physical capital.  He also cited the launch this week of its new financial innovation; the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's Fund for the poorest countries, which innaugural bond raised $1.5billiion from investors around the world (amongst other efforts), as ways the Group is dedicated to ending poverty wherever it exists in its client countries.
