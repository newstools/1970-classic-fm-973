The Senate has summoned the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele and Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun and Minister of Defense, Mr Mansur Dan-Alli to shed more light on an alleged extra budgetary spending for the purchase of Helicopter without National Assembly’s approval‎.  The lawmakers took this decision after Senator Sam Anyanwu’s point of Order, informing them that in March 2018 $462m was withdrawn to buy helicopters without the approval of the National Assembly.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Deputy Senate president, Sen. Ike Ekwerenmadu who presided over plenary, referred the matter to the Senate Committee on Appropriations to report back in a week.
